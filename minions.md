Minions are a feature in Old School Bot that let you simulate playing a virtual RuneScape account in Discord. You control a minion, who you send out to do various tasks, like killing monsters for loot, completing clue scrolls, and training skills. With the loot they get, you can craft items, sell them, and trade to other real players.

You can also read the [FAQ](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/faq) for answers to common questions.

> Minions are entirely virtual, and not in any way tradeable for real GP or real money. It's simulating the real game for fun. We strictly do not allow any bot users to break any of the official OSRS rules. Read the rules here: [Old School Bot Rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules)


If you notice any mistakes or missing information in this page, you can [add it yourself](https://github.com/gc/obdocs/blob/master/minions.md), or report it to us in the [support server](https://discord.gg/ob)

[Edit this page on Github](https://github.com/gc/obdocs/blob/master/minions.md)


# Getting started

To get started, firstly [read the rules](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/rules), then get yourself a minion by typing `+minion buy`, or `+m buy` for short. If your Discord account is 6 months old or older, your minion will be free. If it is between 1 and 6 months old, your minion will cost 20m. If your account is less than one month old, you are currently unable to purchase a minion as a precaution against alt accounts and bots (unless you become a patron which bypasses this restriction). To get your starting gp, you can use the `+daily` command every 12 hours to get a trivia question you can answer for gp and special Diango items.

Next, decide what you want to do. Skilling? PVM? Questing? Read the rest of the page to see what you can do, and how - and just do whatever you want to do!

It's highly recommended to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/ob) for several reasons: All updates and changes to the bot are announced in the #news channel in the server. We have a #grand-exchange channel you can use to trade/sell items with others. We have a #notifications channel that shows all the rare drops, pets, and other things that people are getting in real time!

 Some bosses have requirements, like Quest points or gear, refer to [Boss and monster requirements](https://www.oldschool.gg/oldschoolbot/minions?Boss%20and%20monster%20requirements) for more information or use the `+monster` command in the bot. 
 
 Don't know what you want to kill? Use the `+m k random` command to send your minion off to kill a random monster, limited to monsters you have the requirements to kill.
  
 You can view your minions' killcounts using `+m kc`.
 
#### Group Bossing

Some bosses are able to be killed in groups, these bosses currently are: All four GWD bosses, and Corp - more bosses are planned to be added. To do group bossing, you create a party, there are two kinds of parties: invite-only and mass. Invite only parties are for you to invite select people on your trip and mass parties can be joined by anyone. Parties have a leader, who is the person who created the party (ran the command).

Note that, similar to ingame, even if you have a very big group of people in a party killing a boss, you're still limited by that bosses respawn time, although the kills can get very very fast if you have lots of people.

Loot is rolled out completely randomly, for example if your party is doing 5 kills, it will give each kill loot to a random party member, the same person can be given loot multiple times, or none at all if unlucky.

Currently, boosts do not apply to group boss trips, however this will be added in the future.

You **cannot** join parties if: you're an ironman or if your minion is busy.

##### Invite-only group bossing
Example of invite-only group bossing party: `+groupkill party corp @Magnaboy @Alexsuperfly @Crow653` - this would make an invite-only party, that only those 3 people can join. Note that, the leader (the person who is running the command) doesn't have to add themselves to the list, they're always included automatically.

After, each user will have to confirm they want to join by clicking on the "join" reaction. The trip will start when all users have confirmed, or if the party leader has clicked the "start" reaction to start early.


##### Mass bossing
Example of a mass bossing party: `+groupkill mass corp` - this would make a mass party, that ANYONE can join. The trip will start after 2 minutes automatically, or when the party leader clicks the "start" reaction.

#### Fight Caves
You can now challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to recieve a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+fightcaves` command. Requirements: total +160 range bonus equipped to your range gear setup, 43 prayer, 10x Prayer Potion (4), 4x Super Restore (4), and 6x Saradomin Brew (4) per attempt, some of which may be returned to you should you fail before the final wave. You can make the 4 dose potions from 3, 2, and 1 dose drops using the `+decant` command. Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes, as will total Jad kc. Having a Saradomin Godsword equipped in your melee gear setup will reduce your chances of dying before Jad by 4%, and the number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached. 

If you have extra fire capes, you can gamble them for an additional roll at the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+capegamble` command. 

#### Equipping Gear
When sending your minion out on boss or skilling trips, you can equip it with gear to improve its speed and effeciency. For convenience, there is a gear setup for melee, range, mage, skilling, and misc. Depending on the activity your minion is doing will depend on which gear is used. For example, taking on the fightcaves uses your minion's **range** gear setup as well as the Saradomin Godsword if it is equipped in your **melee** gear setup. Whereas going mining will use your minion's **skilling** gear setup. You can equip any equippable items you want into the different setups.
When an item is equipped, it is removed from your bank to the gear setup. When unequipped, the item moves back to your bank.

To **equip** an item into a setup, use: `+equip [setup] [item]`. For example, to equip a Bandos chestplate to the melee setup, you would use the command: `+equip melee bandos chestplate`. To **unequip** an item from a setup, use: `+unequip [setup] [item]`. For example: `+unequip melee bandos chestplate`.

To view your currently equipped gear, use: `+gear [setup]`. For example, to see your skilling setup, use: `+gear skilling`.

Just like dropping a pet ingame and having it follow you, your minion can also equip a pet. This will keep your minion company while it's out working hard to earn you items and gp. To equip a pet, use: `+equippet [pet name]` and it will show on all your gear setups. To unequip it, use: `+unequippet`.


## Agility
You can train Agility using `+laps [quantity] <course>`, for example `+laps 10 canifis`.

## Crafting
You can train Crafting with the `+craft` command. For example, `+craft 100 leather gloves`. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `+craft leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.

## Prayer
You can train Prayer by burying bones, or offering them to the Chaos altar. For example to bury 100 Dragon bones, you can do `+bury 100 Dragon bones`, or to bury the maximum amount you can: `+bury Dragon bones`. Offering the bones to the Chaos altar works exactly the same, except you use `+offer` instead, for example: `+offer 100 Dragon bones`.

The Chaos Altar works like ingame, your minion will do 1 inventory trips back and forth to sacrifice, with a 10% chance of being PKed in the trip and losing some amount of your inventory of bones (depending on if you got PKed at the start/middle/finish).

The Prayer skill is also required for creating Spirit shields.

## Fletching

You can train Fletching with the `+fletch` command. For example, `+fletch 10000 adamant dart`. To start off training Fletching, you will want to `+chop` some logs for arrow shafts, and then `+fletch arrow shaft` them into arrow shafts. Alternativley, you can buy logs or unfinished fletching supplies from our #grand-exchange channel in the support server. 

To see all the items you can fletch, check out the [Fletching Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fletching) - most of the items found there are fletchable in the bot, having the exact same level and item requirements. 

## Questing
Questing in the bot is simple and easy, and roughly 20% faster than ingame. Instead of doing specific quests, you just "quest" and gain QP for "questing". You can keep questing until you reach the max QP. The amount of QP you recieve per trip scales down as you progress, with averages of 4 QP/hr from 0 to 100 QP, 3 QP/hr from 100-200 QP, and 2 QP/hr from 200-277 QP. 

Quest points are required to kill some bosses (e.g. Vorkath) and required to buy some items (e.g. Barrows gloves).

Questing recieves a 10% boost if you have the full Graceful outfit equipped in your skilling gear setup.

## Skillcapes

Upon reaching level 99 in a skill, you can purchase a skillcape for 99k by typing `+skillcape <skill_name>`. If it's your first 99, you'll get an untrimmed cape.

# Bank Backgrounds

If you meet the requirements and costs of a background, you can get it using `+bankbg <name>`. The image will replace the background of your bank. Bank backgrounds require that you pay GP, items and having certain items in your collection log, they are quite hard to obtain.

Click on the bank bg name to see what it looks like.

# Minion Icons

You can sacrifice items, and their GP value will go towards you unlocking new minion icons. You will automatically receive the icon immediately after sacrificing enough GP. You can see a leaderboard of who has sacrificed the most using `+lb sacrifice`.

You can sacrifice items using `+sacrifice [quantity] <item>`, like `+sacrifice Bandos chestplate` or `+sacrifice 1000 gold ore`. You cannot sacrifice GP, instead you should buy items off other players with your GP and sacrifice those.
